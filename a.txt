Also make a cypher query for knowledge.
lets say you get the entity as the keyword FROM THE QUESTION and you identify the relation, the code would be stricly this:
"MATCH (e {{name: entity}})-[r:relation]-(related)
RETURN e,r,related"
give only single cypher query
just give output for cypher as:
Cypher code is:
"(the code)"
and dont include ``` this is in the answer.
If there is NO relation found, do not generate cypher code, just print No cypher code for the above answer.
User's question: {user_input}
Just give the direct answers, based on the prompts given above strictly!!
