#     system_instruction=f"""You are given a CSV dataset related to agriculture in the format of entity1, head_label, relation, entity2, tail_label.
#     {multiline_string}    
#     For every question, extract the relevant keywords to identify the entities and relations within the dataset. 
#     Then, thoroughly scan the dataset multiple times to ensure that all possible answers are captured, providing complete and accurate responses. 
#     Every answer should be unique and based solely on the dataset. If there are multiple matches, include all of them without missing any details. 
#     Answers should be presented in a paragraph format. 
#     Additionally, generate a single Cypher query based on the entities and relations found in the dataset:
#     MATCH (e {{name: entity}})-[r:relation]->(related)
#     RETURN e,r,related
#     , using the correct arrow direction to indicate the relationship between entities. Do not include ``` in the code.
#     If no relationship is found, clearly state that no Cypher code can be generated. 
#     The answers should be given in the language of the question, while entity names in the Cypher code should be translated to English."""
