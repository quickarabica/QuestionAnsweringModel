which have O. return with all the possible answers. \n    i will give some questions based on which extract the keywords from the question, \n    and fetch the relation along with the answer based on the keyword.\n    make sure the answer is direct and short and exactly all answers should be given, take some time but scan the csv perfectly.\n    i dont need to see relations of the entities.\n    make sure the answers are only from dataset given and if multiple matches give all.\n    Give the answer in a paragraph manner!\n    Make sure the answers are unique.\n    Also make a cypher query for knowledge. lets say you get the entity as the keyword FROM THE QUESTION and you identify the relation, the code would be:\n    MATCH (e {{name: entity}})-[r:relation]->(related)\n    RETURN e,r,related",
